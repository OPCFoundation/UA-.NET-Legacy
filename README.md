# OPC Foundation UA .NET-Legacy

This repository is provided by OPC Foundation as legacy support for older .NET Framework versions and will not receive further features and updates.

The official Unified Architecture .NET Stack maintained by OPC Foundation will be based on .NET Standard and can be found [here](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard).

Only critical security updates will be provided for this repository.

**The end of life for this codebase is 2022-12-31. All users should migrate to [UA-.NETStandard](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard) before then.**
